## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Set Up CI Integration with Dockerization

### Step 1: [Create a GitHub Repository](https://github.com/new)
- Start by creating a new repository in your GitHub account. This will be the home for your `.NET 8.0 Blazor` project.

### Step 2: Push Your Project to GitHub
- Commit and push your `.NET 8.0 Blazor` project to this new repository.
- To push your local code:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git push origin main
  
### Step 3 : Create a Dockerfile
```C#
# Base image for running the app in Debug mode
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base
USER app
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

# Stage for building the project
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["Service Libraries Path/your.csproj", "Service Libraries Path/"]
RUN dotnet restore "your presentation layer location/your.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/your directory"
RUN dotnet build "your.csproj" -c $BUILD_CONFIGURATION -o /app/build

# Stage for publishing the project
FROM build AS publish
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
RUN dotnet publish "your.csproj" -c $BUILD_CONFIGURATION -o /app/publish /p:UseAppHost=false

# Final stage for production
FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "your.dll"]

```

### Step 4: Set Up GitHub Secrets 
To securely store your DockerHub credentials for GitHub Actions, follow these steps:
1. Go to your repository's **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**.
3. Add the following secrets:
   - **DOCKERHUB_USERNAME** ‚Äì Your DockerHub username.
   - **DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD** ‚Äì Your DockerHub password.
   
These secrets will be securely referenced in your GitHub Actions workflow.
